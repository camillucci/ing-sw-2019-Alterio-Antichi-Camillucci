For legibility reasons, in the UML Class Diagram are not represented:
- the 21 weapon classes, subclasses of WeaponCard;
- the 4 powerUp classes, subclasses of PowerUpCard;
- the constructors of each class;
- the ordinary getter and setter methods of each class;
- some association relations, which are anyway represented through attributes.
